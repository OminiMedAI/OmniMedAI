# OmniMedAI: Omni Medical AI Platform

![img](./logo.png)

## Abstract

OmniMedAI is an advanced AI-driven platform designed to integrate and analyze heterogeneous medical data, including radiological imaging, digital pathology, genomics, and clinical records. Leveraging cutting-edge techniques in radiomics, deep learning, habitat analysis, and multi-instance learning, the platform enables researchers and clinicians to build robust predictive models for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and personalized treatment planning.

1. **Data Integration Module**  
   • Supports import of DICOM, CSV, HDF5, and other formats.  

   • Integrates tools like ITK-SNAP (for ROI segmentation in radiology) and 3D Slicer (for 3D visualization).  

2. **Preprocessing Engine**  
   • Normalization: Z-score scaling and min-max normalization to [-1, 1].  

   • Data Augmentation: Random cropping, horizontal/vertical flipping (training-only).  

   • Whole-Slide Image (WSI) Processing: QuPath (annotation) + CellProfiler (feature extraction) for histopathology.  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   • Radiomics: Extracts 1,500+ features (shape, texture, intensity) using Pyradiomics (e.g., Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filtering, wavelet transforms).  

   • Deep Learning: Models like UNet (segmentation), Swin Transformer (feature extraction), and transfer learning with ResNet/DenseNet.  

   • Pathomics: Grad-CAM visualization + TF-IDF weighted bag-of-words (BoW) for WSI analysis.  

4. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   • Algorithms: COX regression, SVM, XGBoost, LightGBM.  

   • Metrics: AUC, F1-score, calibration curves, decision curve analysis (DCA).  

   • Federated Learning: Secure, decentralized training across institutions.

## Technical Highlights  

1. Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) Fusion  
    • Probability Histogram (PLH): Generates slice-level prediction distributions.  

    • BoW with TF-IDF: Encodes slice-level features into a global signature.  

    • Early Fusion: Concatenates PLH and BoW features:  

    $$
    \text{feature}_{fusion} = Histo_{prob} \oplus Histo_{pred} \oplus Bow_{prob} \oplus Bow_{pred}
    $$

2. Survival Analysis & Imbalanced Data Handling  
    • KM Survival Curves: Log-rank test for group comparison:  

    $$
    \hat{S}(t) = \prod_{t_i \leq t} \left(1 - \frac{d_i}{n_i}\right)
    $$
    • SMOTE Oversampling: Balances classes during training.  

3. Model Interpretability  
    • Grad-CAM: Visualizes attention maps for radiology/WSI models.  

    • SHAP Values: Quantifies feature importance (e.g., gene mutations).
